Welcome to my repository, where I share visualizations and analyses based on the datasets provided by [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 

## Tools and Approach

I primarily use tools such as **Python** and **Tableau** for data analysis and visualization. This is a learning journey for me as I explore data and practice my skills in data storytelling and visual representation. 

## About Me

Iâ€™m a beginner in data visualization and analysis, eager to improve my craft. Constructive feedback, suggestions, or discussions are always appreciated! Your insights will help me grow as I continue this journey.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to leave your comments, or reach out if you'd like to discuss these visualizations or collaborate on data-related projects. 

Thank you for stopping by!
